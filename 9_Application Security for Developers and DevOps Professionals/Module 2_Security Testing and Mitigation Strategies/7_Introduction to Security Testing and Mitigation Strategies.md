Question 1

What are the two types of functional testing?


[X]Ad hoc testing, exploratory testing

That’s right! Ad hoc testing is specialized testing upon discovery of a vulnerability. Exploratory testing takes place outside of formal testing. Some examples are testing a theory or testing an idea.

[ ]Security testing, mitigation testing

[ ]Vulnerability testing, threat modeling

[ ]Mittn testing, Gauntlt testing

Question 2

Your software application includes multiple software modules coded by different developers. You want to be able to test them together as a group. What type of security testing is best suited for testing your application across multiple tiers?


[ ]Functional security testing

[ ]Automated security testing

[ ]Security testing

[X]Integration testing

That’s right! Integration tests are for testing the integration of several coded classes within an application. You can perform integration tests across application tiers and a wide testing scope to expose defects in the interaction between the modules upon integration.

Question 3

In which stage of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) should security testing be performed?


[ ]Maintenance

[X]Test

[ ]Design

[ ]Requirements

That’s right! Security testing takes place during the Test stage of the SDLC along with code review. Although secure code should be a top priority during the Test phase, security should be an integral part of the entire SDLC.

Question 4

You are ready to test the security implementations in your app to see if they work as designed. What type of testing should you perform?


[ ]Unit testing

[ ]Exploratory testing

[ ]Secure baseline testing

[X]Functional testing

That’s right! Functional security testing is the expectation of behavior when you test software or a system. Functional security testing helps you ensure that the code meets your security requirements. To perform functional security testing, you need a list of your functional requirements. Functional security testing should be an integral part of your security testing processes.

Question 5

You wish to help your organization by identifying attacks and vulnerabilities that could affect your application. What technique can you use to help influence your app’s design and help reduce risk to your organization?


[ ]JSON

[X]Threat modeling

That’s right! Threat modeling is a key mitigation strategy. It helps you identify threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures that might affect your application. It helps you predict what could be compromised and also helps you determine how to immediately contain the threat.
