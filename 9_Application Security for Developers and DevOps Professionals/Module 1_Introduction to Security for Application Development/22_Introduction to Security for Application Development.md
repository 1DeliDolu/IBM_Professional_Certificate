Question 4

Why should container scanning check the base image and all other layered container images?


[ ]Code-scanning tools reference databases that store security threats and vulnerabilities.

[X]Container images may have dependencies on other container images with vulnerabilities.

[ ]

Container images, both stored and production, may have open-source code.

[ ]Code scanners provide vulnerability reporting and insights after they scan code repositories.

Correct

Correct! Container images are usually built from other container images that may have vulnerabilities. Container scanning must include the base image and all other layered container images. Monitoring all container images helps reduce security risks.

Question 5

What does it mean to have integrity in application security?


[ ]Verifying a user’s identity

[ ]Adding security testing with continuous integration or continuous delivery (CI/CD) testing

[ ]Encoding information with different keys for encrypting and decrypting

[X]Ensuring that an unauthenticated source has made no changes to your data

Correct

Correct! Integrity is ensuring an unauthenticated source hasn’t changed data.

Question 6

Which OSI layer delivers benefits such as dialog control and token management?


[ ]Application layer

[ ]Presentation layer

[X]Session layer

[ ]Transport layer

Correct

Correct! The session layer, which is the fifth layer of the OSI model, delivers benefits such as dialog control or transmission turn tracking and token management, which eliminates two users simultaneously attempting the same important operation.

Question 7

What is the correct sequence of steps to ensure TLS security in the software development life cycle or SDLC?


[X]Computers agree on TLS version → Computers agree on supported cipher → Server’s identity and TLS certificate signature verification → Computers generate session keys to communicate secretly

[ ]Computers agree on supported cipher → Computers agree on TLS version → Server’s identity and TLS certificate signature verification → Computers generate session keys to communicate secretly

[ ]Computers generate session keys to communicate secretly → Computers agree on TLS version → Computers agree on supported cipher → Server’s identity and TLS certificate signature verification

[ ]Server’s identity and TLS certificate signature verification → Computers agree on supported cipher → Computers agree on TLS version → Computers generate session keys to communicate secretly

Correct

Correct! There are four steps to ensure TLS stays secure in the SDLC. Firstly, the computers must agree on a TLS version to use. Secondly, the computers must agree on a supported cipher to use. Third, the client verifies the server’s identity and TLS certificate signature. Finally, the two computers generate session keys to communicate secretly.

Question 8

When application developers commit code to an application project, which layer should be secured and restricted?


[ ]The frontend of the web application layer

[ ]The communication layer

[ ]The cloud infrastructure layer

[X]Security code delivery pipeline layer

Correct

Correct! When application developers need to commit code to an application project, the security code delivery pipeline layer should also be secured and restricted. To do this, you can lock down the code repositories in GitHub with specific permissions, and conduct audits periodically.

Question 9

A security pattern must provide steps and processes for developers by analyzing and modeling threats. Which of the following is another aspect it should include?


[X]It must trace the threat model back to security to promote reusability.

[ ]It should use the standard taxonomy only for traceability.

[ ]It should use the standard taxonomy only for reusability.

[ ]Its design must be a service.

Correct

Correct! A security pattern must include certain aspects. It must analyze and model the threats to provide steps and processes for developers. Additionally, it must trace the threat model back to security to promote reusability.

[ ]Requirements → Test → Develop → Design → Deploy

[ ]Test → Requirements → Design → Develop → Deploy

[ ]Design → Requirements → Test → Develop → Deploy

[X]Requirements → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy

Correct

Correct! Requirements → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy is the correct sequence of the five stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
