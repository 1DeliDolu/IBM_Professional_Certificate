Question 1

Which of the following reasons led to the creation of the OSI model?


[ ]To prevent the leakage of information from high-security domains to low-security domains

[ ]To enable the creation of diverse security technologies

[X]To allow global use of present and future types of communication

Correct! The pioneers of the internet created the Open Systems Interconnection model or the OSI model to allow for present and future types of communication to be used by everyone globally.

[ ]To enable faster data transfer between servers and clients

Question 2

As an application developer, it is important to test all the layers of a web application. You can do that by running vulnerability scanners, running tests, and _____________________ before deploying for production.


[ ]locking down the code repositories in GitHub with specific permissions

[X]allowing other team developers to audit the web applications

Correct! To test all layers of your web application, you need to run vulnerability scanners, run tests, and allow other team developers to audit the web applications before deploying them for production.

[ ]using the secure sockets layer

[ ]creating security groups to restrict access

Question 3

A security pattern is a set of rules that represent and define a reusable solution to recurring security threats or issues. What is the primary goal of a security pattern?


[ ]Offer monitoring mechanisms, authentication processes, and encryption protocols.

[ ]Provide standardized and proven approaches to mitigate risks.

[X]

Reduce or eliminate future security threats.

Correct! The primary goal of security patterns is to reduce or eliminate future security threats.

[ ]Offer actionable solutions and recommendations for implementing security controls.

Question 4

If you try to intercept a secured communication, it would be useless to you due to which of the following reasons?


[ ]Due to decryption

[ ]Due to missing firewalls

[ ]Due to the skipping of the network layer

[X]Due to encryption

Correct! When the communication is secured, and if someone were to intercept that communication, it would be useless to them because it would be unreadable due to encryption. Encryption is a method in which data is rendered hard to read by an unauthorized party.

Question 5

Which cryptographic service guarantees that the data has not been modified or tampered with during and after the reception?


[X]Cryptographic integrity

Correct! Integrity guarantees that the data has not been modified or tampered with during and after the reception. Cryptographic integrity helps support the anti-tampering of data for users needing data verification between sender and receiver.

[ ]Message digest algorithms

[ ]Public keys

[ ]Confidentiality service
