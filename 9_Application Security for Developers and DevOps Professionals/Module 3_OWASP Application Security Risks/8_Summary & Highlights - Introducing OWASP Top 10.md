Question 1

The OWASP Top 10 core team finds out how to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities each year. The core team follows a series of steps to develop the OWASP Top 10. Which of the following is the fifth major step in developing the OWASP Top 10?


[ ]Publishing a call for data

[ ]Releasing the draft version of the list for public review

[ ]Analyzing the data

[X]Reaching a consensus

Correct! The fifth step in developing the OWASP Top 10 is to reach a consensus. And then, the OWASP core team releases the latest OWASP Top 10.

Question 2

Cryptographic failures are the root cause of sensitive data exposure which may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. What is the best strategy to prevent cryptographic failures?


[ ]Browsing websites using HTTP

[ ]Using simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) and file transfer protocol (FTP)

[X]Using authenticated encryption methods

Correct! The best strategy to prevent cryptographic failures is to encrypt all sensitive data stored in the database using authenticated encryption instead of traditional encryption methods.

[ ]Using traditional encryption methods

Question 3

An attacker is continually searching for vulnerabilities to exploit your application. Which of the following measures will ensure that your application is secure right from the start?


[ ]Fix all the bugs in the application.

[ ]Perform application monitoring at regular intervals.

[ ]Perform firmware updates at regular intervals.

[X]Design applications with security in mind.

Correct! Designing with security in mind ensures your application is as secure as it can be right from the start.

Question 4

An attacker is using server-side request forgery (SSRF) to create or control malicious requests to other internal systems. Which type of SSRF attack is the most dangerous?


[X]Non-blind SSRF

Correct! Non-blind SSRF attacks are the most dangerous. In these attacks, data from any Uniform Resource Identifier (or URI) is returned to the attacker by an internal service.

[ ]Basic or blind SSRF

[ ]Semi-blind SSRF

[ ]Completely-blind SSRF
