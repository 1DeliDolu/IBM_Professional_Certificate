Question 1

Which three levels of the software testing process are appropriate for performing behavior driven development (BDD)?

[ ]Unit testing

[X]Acceptance testing

Correct. BDD is appropriate to use for acceptance testing. At that level of testing, enough of the system is running that developers can evaluate its behavior.

[X]Integration testing

Correct. BDD is an effective approach to integration testing because it forces developers to view the system from the outside in. In other words, they implement only those behaviors that contribute most directly to business outcomes.

[X]System testing

Correct. BDD is appropriate to use for system testing. At that level of testing, enough of the system is running that developers can evaluate its behavior.

Question 2

Why are notations originating in the behavior driven development (BDD) approach so helpful?

[ ]They support object-oriented programming.

[ ]They work well for low-level coding tasks.

[ ]They provide efficient garbage pickup.

[X]They closely resemble everyday language.

Correct. Notations originating in the BDD approach, particularly the given-when-then syntax, are closer to everyday language than the notations of TDD tools, and they have a shallower learning curve. The language is very natural, making BDD very approachable.

Question 3

What happens in the first step of the behavior driven development (BDD) workflow?

[ ]Use a BDD test runner to run automated tests.

[ ]Update the master specification document.

[ ]Note which tests are implemented and working.

[X]Collaborate to produce concrete examples.

Correct. In the first step of the BDD workflow, the developers, testers, and stakeholders collaborate to produce concrete examples describing the desired behavior.
