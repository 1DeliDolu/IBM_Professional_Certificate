Question 2

Why is continued testing important even at 100% test coverage?

[X]To find additional bugs

Correct. Test coverage of 100% only means that every line of code has been tested with some known good data. You can still pass bad data into your code and find bugs.

[ ]To increase the number of lines of code tested

[ ]To identify the lines of code that still need tests

[ ]To improve the code’s readability

Question 3

When generating fakes in Python, what is one purpose for using the Meta class inside the factory?

[ ]Generates a diverse sample of fake data for use in test assertions

[X]Indicates the model class for which the factory will create fakes
