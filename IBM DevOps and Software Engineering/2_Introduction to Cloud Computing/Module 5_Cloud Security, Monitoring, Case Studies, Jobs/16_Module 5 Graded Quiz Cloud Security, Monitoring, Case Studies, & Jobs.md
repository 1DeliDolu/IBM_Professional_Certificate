Question 2

Which of the following are some best practices organizations must follow to protect their cloud resources and systems?

[ ]Run security monitoring tools periodically to ensure security threats and breaches are flagged

[X]Adopt a shared responsibility model of active monitoring for security and compliance

[ ]Distribute tasks, workloads, and monitoring software

[ ]Distribute tasks, workloads, and network traffic

Correct

Correct! Operating applications and services in cloud environments demands understanding the shared accountabilities for security and compliance between the organization and the cloud provider. To ensure stability and enforcement of compliance standards and business continuity, enterprises need to set up active monitoring of all connected systems and cloud-based services.

Question 3

Which of the following are key Identity and Access Management (IAM) components?

[ ]Encryption security practices

[ ]Embedding security through the life cycle of an application

[ ]Protecting data while it is at rest, in motion, and in use

[X]Cloud Directory Services, Audits, and Compliance

Correct

Correct! Cloud Directory Services manage user profiles, associated credentials, and password policies inside a cloud environment. Audit and compliance are critical services within the IAM framework. Auditors use these processes to validate implemented controls against an organization’s security policy, industry compliance, and risk policies to report deviations.

Question 4

Which of these statements is true of cloud encryption?

A. Encryption ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.

B. When encrypted data is intercepted without authorization, it is unreadable and meaningless

C. Encryption protects data when it is at rest, in transit, and in use in memo.

D. Encryption eliminates data security risks.

[ ]A and C only

[X]A, B, and C only

[ ]A, B, C, and D

[ ]A, B, and D only

Correct

Correct! Encryption does not eliminate data security risk—it separates the security risk from the data itself by moving security to the encryption keys.

Question 5

Identify some of the standard cloud monitoring best practices from the provided options.

[X]Leverage end-user experience monitoring solutions to capture the performance of an application from the point of view of its end users and track the usage and cost of your cloud resources and services.

[ ]Encrypt data before it is sent to the cloud.

[ ]Authenticate users attempting to access their cloud resources.

[ ]Encrypt data on a physical storage device.

Correct

Correct! End-user experience monitoring solutions monitor user journeys to track parameters such as application response time and frequency of use. Organizations can leverage cloud monitoring tools to monitor and optimize the usage of their cloud resources and services.

Question 6

What are some of the monitoring tools that help you to gain insights about your posture, compliance, and threats?

[ ]Flow logs and hypervisors

[ ]Data encryption

[ ]Hypervisors

[X]Flow logs from the network and security events

Correct

Correct! Flow logs help to monitor information about how the network resources are operating. Security events indicate when a security policy may have been violated.

Question 7

What are some of the benefits of using access groups?

[ ]Access groups create an additional level of authentication for application users.

[ ]Access groups define the users, the resources to which access is granted, and the permission level each user has on these resources.

[ ]Access groups help increase the number of policies of an account.

[X]The use of access groups helps to reduce the number of policies in an account. Access groups provide a more streamlined way to assign access rights.

Correct

Correct! Access policies defined at a group level mean lesser access policies, leading to increased performance. Access groups make it possible to assign the same access to all entities within group 76.

Question 8

Identify the two main parts of an encryption system from the provided options.

[ ]Physical encryption device

[X]The encryption algorithm and decryption key

[ ]Server-side encryption

[ ]Client-side encryption

Correct

Correct! The encryption algorithm defines the rules by which data is scrambled to become illegible. The decryption key defines how the encrypted data will be transformed back to legible data.

Question 9

What are some of the benefits that cloud monitoring solutions offer?

[X]Troubleshoot applications and infrastructure

Correct

Correct! Round-the-clock monitoring tools provide data and notifications in real-time, helping developers and administrators troubleshoot and resolve issues.

[ ]Prevent unauthorized users from accessing the systems

[X]Accelerate the diagnosis and resolution of performance incidents and provide proactive notifications of abnormal or unusual situations.

Correct

Correct! Cloud monitoring solutions are designed to give organizations complete visibility and control over the performance of their cloud resources. Cloud monitoring solutions help mitigate the impact of abnormal situations by providing proactive notifications.

Question 10

The Weather Company migrated its weather web property to a secure, scalable, and global architecture in the IBM Cloud. What benefits did they realize as a result of this migration?

[ ]Increase development and increased latency

[X]Harness local data centers to minimize latency for users and optimize their systems for elasticity in handling extreme spikes in demand

Correct

Correct! Since the weather is a hyper-local phenomenon, the scalability of the web platform needs to be localized, which is made possible with cloud technologies. The Weather Company leveraged the cloud’s scalability to handle massive, short-notice peak workloads.

[ ]Increase asset availability and overall equipment effectiveness

[X]Faster development and release of new apps and digital self-service tools to customers

Correct

Correct!  DevOps and cloud-native features enabled rapid innovation and deployment of weather-related apps and tools.
