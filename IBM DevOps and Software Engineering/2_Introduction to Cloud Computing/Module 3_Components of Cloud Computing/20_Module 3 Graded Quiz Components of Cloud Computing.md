Question 1

Each Cloud Region can have multiple Availability Zones. What are Zones ?

[ ]Geographic area or region where the cloud provider’s infrastructure is clustered

[ ]Standardized containers of computing resources

[X]Unique physical locations with one or more data centers

[ ]Single shared point of failure

Correct

Correct! Zones, or Availability Zones, are distinct locations with one or more data centers with power, cooling, and networking resources.

Question 2

Which of the following is a benefit of virtualization?

[ ]Increases your downtime

[ ]Is secure

[ ]Runs a single operating system

[X]Cost savings

Correct

Correct! You can run multiple virtual environments from one piece of infrastructure, which means that you can drastically reduce your physical infrastructure footprint.

[ ]Transient or Spot VMs

[ ]Dedicated hosts

[ ]Shared or Public Cloud VMs

[X]Reserved virtual servers

Correct

Correct. Users can reserve specific virtual server instances for guaranteed capacity.

Question 5

Subnets are the main area where security is implemented in the cloud. Which of the following is used to provide security at the virtual instance level in subnets?

[ ]Public Gateways

[X]Security Groups or SGs

[ ]Virtual Private Cloud or VPC

[ ]Load Balancers

Correct

Correct! SGs provide instance-level security.

Question 6

Which of the following is a benefit of isolation of applications in containers?

[ ]Repackaged into containers or containerized microservices

[ ]Abstraction from the host operating system

[ ]Open-sourced runtime engine

[X]Preventing malicious code in one container from impacting other containers

Correct

Correct! The isolation of applications in containers reduces the chance that malicious code in one container will impact other containers or invade the host system.

### 7.

Question 7

Which of the following storage types are ephemeral or non-persistent?

[X]Direct Attached storage

[ ]File storage

[ ]Object storage

[ ]Block storage

Correct

Correct! Direct Attached storage, also known as “local storage,” is ephemeral as it is no longer accessible once the VM it’s attached to is de-provisioned.

### 8.

Question 8

What makes File storage an ideal solution for scenarios where shared storage is required?

[X]File storage can be mounted on multiple compute nodes at the same time

[ ]File Storage is mounted to compute nodes via an ethernet network

[ ]Fast accessibility of file storage over the network

[ ]File storage can be mounted from remote storage appliances

Correct

Correct! The ability for File Storage to be mounted to various compute nodes at a time makes it an ideal solution for shared storage requirements.

### 9.

Question 9

Which of the following scenarios is best suited for Block Storage?

[ ]Workloads that need disk sharing between compute nodes

[X]Applications that need consistent fast access to the disk, such as databases

[ ]Where workloads do not require fast connectivity to storage

[ ]Low cost is a consideration

Correct

Correct! Fiber optic networks move traffic at consistently high speeds, making them ideal for applications that need consistent and fast access.

### 10.

Question 10

Which of the following is a feature of Object storage?

[X]You can directly use Object Storage without attaching it to a compute node

[ ]Storage is attached to compute nodes using a fiber network

[ ]Used where fast read and write speeds are necessary

[ ]Object Storage can be mounted on multiple compute nodes via an ethernet network

Correct

Correct! You don’t need an underlying compute node to connect to object storage. Instead, you can access it from anywhere using an API.
