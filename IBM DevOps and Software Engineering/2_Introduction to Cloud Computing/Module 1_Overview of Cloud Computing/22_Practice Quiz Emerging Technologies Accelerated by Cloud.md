Question 3

What is the three-way relationship between blockchain, AI, and the Cloud?

[ ]Globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources.

[ ]Lends trust and transparency to AI by recording the data and variables that go into a decision made in an AI algorithm.

[X]Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the collected data, and Cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both technologies.

Correct! This is the mutually beneficial, three-way relationship between Blockchain, AI, and Cloud.

[ ]Blockchain provides an immutable network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
