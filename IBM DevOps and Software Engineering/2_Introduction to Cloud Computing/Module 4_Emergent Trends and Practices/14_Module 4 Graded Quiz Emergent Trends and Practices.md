Question 4

How would a global flower delivery company leverage the Hybrid Multicloud architecture to meet its requirement of varying capacity demands across different geographies?

[ ]By using the automatic provisioning and de-provisioning of resources that the cloud offers.

[X]By distributing their delivery service application across multiple cloud environments and providers spread across multiple geographies.

[ ]By scaling up their on-premises architecture

Correct

Correct! Moving their UI and Billing capabilities over to a North American Public Cloud Data Center, while their core application continues to reside in an on-premises data center in Europe allowed the flower delivery company to scale up portions of their application in response to a surge in demand over the American holidays.

Question 5

Which of the following statements describes the DevOps approach and process?

[ ]Eliminates the need to monitor performance and availability.

[ ]An approach that utilizes cloud applications to monitor systems.

[X]DevOps process is a collaborative approach that defines how people build, deploy, and manage applications in a cloud-native environment to deliver software continuously.

[ ]Eliminates the need to provision servers, build middleware, and install application code.

Correct

Correct! Cloud-native applications form a complex distributed system. DevOps defines the process that helps teams work in the native cloud environment.

Question 6

Which of these scenarios is NOT a good use case for serverless architecture?

[ ]Supporting microservices architecture

[X]Workloads characterized by long-running processes

[ ]Microservices that can be built as stateless functions

[ ]Stream processing workloads

Correct

Correct! For workloads characterized by long-running processes, managing a traditional server environment might be simpler and more cost-effective.

### 7.

Question 7

 How can the microservices architecture approach be characterized ?

[ ] Requirement to build every new functionality in a microservice from the ground up.

[ ] Impact on the entire application when one microservice ceases to function.

[ ] Compulsion to bundle all microservices for a specific task into a single container.

[X] Decomposition of large applications into core functions to construct a comprehensive and functional application.

Correct

Correct.  Microservices architecture involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent components (microservices) that handle specific core functions. This approach enhances modularity, scalability, and maintainability by allowing each microservice to operate independently.

Question 8

Fill in the blank. Microservices architecture is an approach in which a ______________ comprises many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services.

[ ]Repository application

[ ]Server

[X]Single application

[ ]Cloud service

Correct

Correct! These services typically have their stack running on their own containers. They communicate over APIs, event streaming, and message brokers.

Question 9

What does a cloud native application consist of?

[X]Microservices

[ ]Application containers

[ ]Executable files

[ ]Executable containers

Correct

Correct! These microservices are often packaged in containers, which are executable units of software in which the application code is packaged along with its libraries and dependencies so that it can be run anywhere.
