# Final Project: Submission and Evaluation


In this final project submission, you will demonstrate your understanding of Agile project management using a Kanban board.

You are not creating new items here — instead, you will **submit screenshots and a repository URL** showing that all Agile project elements have already been created and set up correctly.

This submission includes  **9 tasks** , each requiring proof (via screenshots or URL) of your work — such as your Kanban board, user story template, sprint setup, estimates, and burndown chart.


## Instructions

Before you start submitting, make sure the following items are **ready and visible** in your project:

1. Your **Kanban board** is created and has visible columns such as  *Product Backlog* ,  *Sprint Backlog* ,  *In Progress* ,  *Review/QA* , and  *Done* .
2. Your  **public GitHub repository (** `<strong>agile-final-project</strong>`**)** contains a folder `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` with a valid `user-story.md` file.
3. Your **user-story.md file** follows the proper template format —
4. “As a [role], I need [function], so that [benefit].”
5. Each user story includes **acceptance criteria** written in Gherkin syntax —
6. “Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome].”
7. All stories have **labels** applied (for example,  *enhancement* ,  *technical debt* ).
8. All stories are assigned **estimates** in the *In Progress* and *Done* columns.
9. A **Sprint or Milestone** is created with a clear, meaningful title.
10. All stories in non-empty columns are **assigned to that Sprint or Milestone.**
11. All stories in active columns ( *In Progress* ,  *Review/QA* ,  *Done* ) are **assigned to you.**
12. A **burndown chart** exists for your Sprint or Milestone showing story progress.
13. Stories for **requirements 9 and 10** are labeled as **Technical Debt.**

Once these elements are ready, upload the required screenshots/repository URL as per the task.

## Grading Criteria

Your final grade will be based on the following tasks, with a total of 20 points possible:

**Task 1 (1 pt):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `01-kanban-board.jpeg` or `01-kanban-board.png` of the final project Kanban board.

**Task 2 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `02-product-backlog.jpeg` or `02-product-backlog.png` showing that labels have been added to all stories across the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Review/QA, and Done columns.

**Task 3 (5 pts):** Submit the public GitHub repository URL of your `user-story.md` file located in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder.

1. A `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder is created in the repository and includes the `user-story.md` file. (1 pt)
2. The user story follows the format: “As a… I need… So that…”. (2 pts)
3. Acceptance criteria are written using Gherkin syntax: “Given… When… Then…”. (2 pts)

**Task 4 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `04-labeled-technical-debt.jpeg` or `04-labeled-technical-debt.png` showing that stories for requirements 9 and 10 are labeled as Technical Debt.

**Task 5 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `05-sprint-created.jpeg` or `05-sprint-created.png` showing that a Sprint or Milestone is created with a title.

**Task 6 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `06-estimate-assigned.jpeg` or `06-estimate-assigned.png` showing that you assigned estimates to all the stories across the "In Progress" and "Done" columns.

**Task 7 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `07-assigned-yourself.jpeg` or `07-assigned-yourself.png` showing that all the stories are assigned to yourself.

**Task 8 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `08-sprint-assigned.jpeg` or `08-sprint-assigned.png` showing that a Sprint or Milestone has been assigned to all the stories across the "In Progress" and "Done" columns.

**Task 9 (2 pts):** Submit a Kanban board screenshot named `09-burndown-chart.jpeg` or `09-burndown-chart.png` of the Burndown chart for the Sprint or Milestone.
