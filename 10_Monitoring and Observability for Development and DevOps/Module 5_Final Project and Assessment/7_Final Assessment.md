### 8.

Question 8

Your monitoring system has an alerting feature that you’ve configured to the best of your ability. It is working; however, it isn’t detecting some problems quickly enough. At other times, alarms are triggered by normal operations. What could be the cause?

[ ]The servers you’re monitoring are overloaded, need upgrades, and are experiencing legitimate issues – causing the alerting feature to misfire

[X]You receive genuine and false alerts indicating that the alert feature works. Perhaps you need to calibrate your thresholds.

[ ]You’re unsure because you’ve set up alerts to catch as many problems as possible

[ ]There are legitimate issues occurring that are triggering alarms, and you haven’t figured out what’s causing false alarms

Correct! Thresholds set too broadly prevent the monitoring system from detecting problems quickly enough. Affected systems or apps could experience higher levels of performance degradation, leading to downtime. Thresholds set too sensitively trigger false alarms. In both cases, re-evaluate the threshold baseline and adjust monitors to improve the detectability of real issues.
