Question 1

What is the goal of observability?

[ ]Identify issues, track trends, and make informed decisions

[X]Faster identification and resolution of issues

Correct! Observability aims to enable faster identification and resolution of issues, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient systems.

[ ]Ensure that applications and web pages are responsive

[ ]Ensure that an application or service is up and responding


### 2.

Question 2

Which of the following is an advantage of metrics?

[X]Metrics are highly quantitative to associate with alerting thresholds

Correct! Metrics are numerical measurements with accompanying attributes that show the health of a particular system component. They are highly quantitative and often intuitive to associate with alerting thresholds.

[ ]Metrics are an extremely easy format to generate

[ ]Metrics can debug issues in a distributed system

[ ]The granular information from metrics allows retrospective replaying of support incidents


### 3.

Question 3

How does implementing a robust observability solution provide an advantage in terms of reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)?

[X]By identifying correlations between events for expedited troubleshooting

Correct! Observability helps reduce MTTR by identifying correlations between events, which expedites the troubleshooting process.

[ ]By monitoring individual systems effectively

[ ]By gaining insights into system resource utilization

[ ]By enabling a reactive approach to troubleshoot


### 4.

Question 4

Which of the following cloud observability tools enables unlimited storage capacity for Prometheus deployments?

[ ]AWS CloudWatch

[ ]New Relic

[X]Thanos

Correct! Thanos enables unlimited storage capacity for Prometheus deployments, allowing organizations utilizing multiple Prometheus servers and clusters access to global metrics views.

[ ]FleuntD


### 5.

Question 5

Which of the following is the correct advantage of sampling in observability?

[ ]Sampling provides high resolution in monitoring systems

[ ]Sampling always makes it easy to diagnose complex performance issues.

[ ]Sampling accurately represents the actual data.

[X]Sampling reduces computational overhead and storage requirements.

Correct! Sampling reduces the amount of data collected, which in turn reduces the computational overhead and storage requirements.
