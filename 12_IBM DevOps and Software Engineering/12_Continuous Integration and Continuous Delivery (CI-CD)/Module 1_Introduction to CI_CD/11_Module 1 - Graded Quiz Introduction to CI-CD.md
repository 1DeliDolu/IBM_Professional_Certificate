Question 1

What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?

[X]An automation process with which you can prepare code for release and deploy the code to an environment

[ ]An automation process with which you can continuously push changes to production

[ ]An automation process with which you can receive instant notifications if the application or infrastructure fails

[ ]An automation process with which you can integrate your work into your repository

Correct

Correct. CD is an automation process with which you can prepare code for release and deploy the code to an environment.

Question 2

Which component of a DevOps pipeline consists exclusively of the Release, Deploy, and Operate phases?

[ ]Continuous Integration

[ ]Continuous Monitoring

[X]Continuous Delivery

[ ]Continuous Alerting

Question 3

Which aspect of development is reduced by using Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)?

[X]Integration risk

[ ]Quality assurance

[ ]Up-front costs

[ ]Monitoring requirements

Correct

Correct. One benefit of using CI/CD is reduced code integration risk. The more you integrate, the less time you have to make changes, so integrating more often means less risk of something breaking.

Question 4

What is an important consideration when using DevOps pipeline tools?

[ ]That all teams use the same tools

[ ]That all teams use different tools

[X]That the tools automate processes

[ ]That the tools slow down processes

Correct

Correct. Different teams within the same company can use different Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools. What’s important is that the tools that you use automate processes.

Question 5

Which tool is a hosted Continuous Integration (CI) service that helps developers build and test software projects hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket?

[ ]Kubernetes

[X]Travis CI

[ ]DockerHub

[ ]Rancher

Correct

Correct. Travis CI is a hosted CI service that helps developers build and test software projects hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket.

Question 6

Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), how should developers approach provisioning infrastructure?

[ ]Modify settings of similar infrastructure and reprovision.

[ ]Create self-modifying code that dynamically provisions.

[X]Provide instructions in a textual format like YAML.

[ ]Provision the infrastructure manually.

Correct

Correct. Using IaC, developers should provide instructions in a textual format like YAML to provision infrastructure.

Question 7

Which Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach requires you to define the specific order of commands needed to achieve the desired state?

[ ]Interrogative

[X]Imperative

[ ]Declarative

[ ]Exclamatory

Correct

Correct. With the imperative approach, you must define the specific order of commands needed to achieve the desired state. Then, the tool executes the commands in that order.

Question 8

Which file type contains a list of servers or devices that an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool uses to provision infrastructure?

[ ]Binary

[ ]Executable

[X]Inventory

[ ]Publishing

Correct

Correct. Inventory files contain a list of servers or devices from which an IaC tool draws to provision infrastructure. Inventory files can also contain the relevant variables needed when a connection triggers for a device or group of devices.

Question 9

What is a benefit of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

[ ]Reduced length of scripts

[X]Improved use of developers’ time

[ ]Improved buy-in from stakeholders

[ ]Reduced complexity of code

Correct

Correct. With IaC, developers spend less time on the pipeline’s plumbing and more time on mission-critical software solutions.

Question 10

Which Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool uses a declarative, or automatic, approach with a pre-execution check to ensure that the tool achieves the desired result?

[ ]SaltStack

[X]Terraform

[ ]Chef

[ ]Ansible

Correct

Correct. Terraform uses a declarative, or automatic, approach with a pre-execution check to ensure that the tool achieves the desired result.
