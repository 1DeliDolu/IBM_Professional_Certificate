Question 1

What is vulnerability scanning?


[ ]It is the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, reporting, remediating, and managing all cyber threats throughout an organization

[ ]It is the process of fixing or neutralizing weaknesses in an organization's IT infrastructure

[X]It is the process of searching for security vulnerabilities from within an application's code and from outside of the application using vulnerability scanning

Correct! It is the search for security vulnerabilities from within an application's code and from outside of the application using vulnerability scanning tools such as Coverity, CodeSonar, Synk Code, and static reviewer-type tools.

[ ]It is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system

Question 3

What is the primary function of a vulnerability scanner?


[ ]A tool used to scan the requirements document for a new application to see if there are any fundamental flaws found in the design document

[ ]A tool developed by OWASP Top 10 to help manage and maintain the list of top 10 of the world's most critical vulnerabilities

[X]It is an automated tool that checks for vulnerabilities in software code

Correct! A vulnerability scanner is a code analysis tool that helps you find security flaws by analyzing your source code or compiled versions of your code.

Question 4

Which threat model methodology checks for the following threat categories: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privileges?


[ ]VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat)

[ ]PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)

[X]STRIDE

Correct! STRIDE is an effective modeling strategy used to help find potential threats during the design phase of an application. Here is an easy way to remember: "STRIDE" is comprised of the six threat categories included in its model: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privileges.

Question 5

What is threat modeling?


[X]The identification, categorization, and enumeration of possible security threats to an application

Correct! The process of threat modeling is: Detect, Analyze, and Eliminate. Security, IT, and software development teams collaborate to identify, understand, and eliminate weaknesses, design flaws, and other vulnerabilities in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

[ ]A process used to identify which malware hackers are using in your organization

[ ]The process used by hackers to model your network implementation to see which vulnerabilities are exploitable

[ ]The use of artificial intelligence or machine learning to help hackers discover and model your network applications
