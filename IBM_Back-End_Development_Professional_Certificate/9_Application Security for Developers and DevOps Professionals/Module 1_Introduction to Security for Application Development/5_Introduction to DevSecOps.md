Question 1

Why is it important to develop secure applications?

[X]To control risk and help protect against security vulnerabilities and threats.

That’s right! By applying Security by Design principles to application development, an organization can ensure that the software was designed to be foundationally secure from the start. Secure applications protect companies against data breaches and other threats.

[ ]It gives the Security Team something to do.

[ ]Because software companies can charge more for secure applications.

[ ]To prevent users from illegally downloading and installing your application on their computers.

Question 2

At which phase, in the software development lifecycle, should threat modeling be performed?

[X]Design phase

That’s right! Performing threat modeling during the Design phase helps secure your design architecture and helps eliminate vulnerabilities and weaknesses early in the Software Development Lifecycle process. While security should be considered in every stage of the Software Development Lifecycle, threat modeling should be performed in the Design phase.

[ ]Development phase

[ ]Requirements phase

[ ]Test phase

Question 3

How can the security team help application developers or DevOps?

[ ]They help write code for the secure parts of the application

[ ]

They ensure that software developers have security clearance for writing application code

[ ]They help application developers and DevOps comprehend the customer’s expectations for the project

[X]They help application developers and the DevOps team to understand threats, evaluate security tools, advise on remediation practices, and write tests

That’s right! Security should not be an afterthought in application development. Security is a team effort. The security team provides valuable expertise that helps ensure that the application is designed securely throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Question 4

What is the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?

[ ]It is the process used by application developers to test their code and programming to see whether it meets client needs and functions smoothly

[X]

It is a framework that specifies the steps involved in software development at each stage

That’s right! The Software Development Lifecycle is a framework that specifies the steps involved in software development at each stage. It details the strategy for developing, deploying, and maintaining a program.

[ ]It is the process used by application developers to release the software application after it has been tested by the project team and has passed each testing phase

[ ]It is the process used by application developers to begin to comprehend the customer’s expectations for the project

Question 5

Why is striving for failure beneficial?

[ ]Everyone uses applications in the same way, so the application shouldn’t fail after it’s released.

[X]It promotes the development of a more secure application.

That’s right! If you can find multiple ways to break your application, system, or network, you can bet that hackers will, too! Security tests, vulnerability tests, and penetration tests can help flush out errors that an organization may not be aware of.

[ ]It can give you a chance to reassess your performance and goals to make you a better software developer and employee.

[ ]Sometimes, you learn more from a single failure than a lifetime of success.
