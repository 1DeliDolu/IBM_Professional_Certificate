Question 10

Select the correct sequence of the five steps followed to implement tracing for container-based applications.

[ ]Choose a tracing tool → Configure the tracing agent → Instrument your code → Deploy the tracer → Verify functionality

[ ]Choose a tracing tool → Verify functionality → Instrument your code → Configure the tracing agent → Deploy the tracer

[ ]Choose a tracing tool → Configure the tracing agent → Verify functionality → Instrument your code → Deploy the tracer

[X]Choose a tracing tool → Instrument your code → Configure the tracing agent → Deploy the tracer → Verify functionality

Correct! Firstly, you choose a tracing tool that can work with your application stack and container orchestrator, like Kubernetes, then you instrument your code to generate traces. Next, you configure the tracing agent for the selected tracing tool, and then you will deploy the tracer along with your containerized application. Finally, you will verify functionality.
