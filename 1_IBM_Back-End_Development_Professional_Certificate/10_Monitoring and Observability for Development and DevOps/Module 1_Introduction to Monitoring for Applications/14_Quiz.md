Question 1

Which one of the following statements is the most appropriate definition of application monitoring?

[ ]Application monitoring is performed solely by a team of technical support specialists who manually watch and maintain applications in order to optimize the user experience.

[ ]Application monitoring prevents all errors, issues, and problems within applications.

[ ]Application monitoring is a wholly automated process, using monitoring tools that observe applications, fix issues, and then deliver updated applications to customers.

[X]Application monitoring is how application developers ensure that their applications are working as intended and are delivering the best user experience.

Correct! Application monitoring ensures that applications perform as intended by allowing developers and their monitoring tools to track app performance, availability, resources, and any issues that negatively impact the user experience.

### 2.

Question 2

Which of the following statements most accurately summarizes the importance of the monitoring process?

[X]Monitoring ensures that an application is healthy, alerts developers and their teams of outages and problems, and helps developers deliver a useful and safe application.

[ ]Monitoring allows developers and operations teams to observe applications on your device and alsoon servers, databases, message queues, and other similar online programs.

[ ]Monitoring is an assessment of whether a solution meets its stated goals, which were determined at the design stage or when the solution was implementeD:

[ ]Monitoring provides visualizations, alerts, tracing, and dependencies tracking in order to maximize the profitability of an application and reputation of the developer.

Correct! Monitoring results in an application that is performing as it should and is valuable to both your business and your customers.

### 3.

Question 3

Which one of the following statements identifies a monitoring type that allows application developers to map resources that an application depends on?

[ ]User tracking and monitoring

[ ]Metric monitoring

[X]Dependency monitoring

[ ]Hall monitoring

Correct! Dependency monitoring maps the resources that an application depends on by evaluating incoming network connections.

### 4.

Question 4

What is the benefit of using different types of monitoring?

[ ]Different monitoring types offer continuous monitoring and user-specific operating system (OS) options.

[X]Using multiple types of monitoring allows you to gain maximum visibility into your application and connected IT systems.

[ ]Different types of monitoring benefits developers by providing options if one type of monitoring tool is unavailable or too expensive.

[ ]Using different monitoring types allows developers to try out different tools in order to be familiar with the maximum number of options.

Correct! There are many types of monitoring tools, and a combination of types can be used to give you visibility into your software and its performance.

### 5.

Question 5

Which one of the following statements explains the importance of using the Golden Signals in Monitoring?

[X]Using the Golden Signals, you can focus on your application’s most critical performance indicators and proactively monitor your application.

[ ]By using the Golden Signals, you reveal to customers how serious you are about your monitoring solutions.

[ ]The Golden Signals are the only four metrics that are important to monitor.

[ ]The Golden Signals include all of the metrics, logs, and information about applications and systems.

Correct! The four Golden Signals are the basic, essential building blocks for any effective monitoring strategy.

### 6.

Question 6

Which one of the four Golden Signals of Monitoring indicates service demand and helps developers fine-tune user experiences?

[ ]Saturation

[ ]Latency

[X]Traffic

[ ]Errors

Correct! The term “traffic” refers to how in-demand your service is and gives you a better understanding of the user-experience.

### 7.

Question 7

Which of the following statements identifies a key difference between monitoring and evaluation?

[ ]Monitoring is only done once at the beginning of application development, and evaluation is only performed at the end of application development.

[ ]Monitoring and evaluation are the same process, and the terms are used interchangeably.

[ ]Monitoring is a process performed by one person, and evaluation is performed by a whole team.

[X]Monitoring is a routine ongoing process, and evaluations are long-term processes that may happen only a few times.

Correct!

### 8.

Question 8

Which one of the following answers describes the three main components of a monitoring system?

[ ]Dashboards, Historical Data, and Timelines

[X]Metrics, Observability, and Alerting

[ ]Visibility, Trends, and Awareness

[ ]Usage, Behavior, and Summaries

Correct! The main components of a monitoring system are Metrics, Observability, and Alerting, which combined provide visibility into the health of your systems.

### 9.

Question 9

Which one of the following answers lists the important metrics you should track in a monitoring system?

[ ]Important metrics to track are stability, resources, project maturity, and level of service that you require.

[ ]You should track the complexity and purpose of your application.

[ ]All metrics are important to track, regardless of your resources available and the purpose of your application.

[X]Important metrics you should track are host-based, application, network and connectivity, and server pool.

Correct! Host-based, application, network, and server pool metrics are important because they represent how your applications use resources and they provide insight into your systems' behavior and health.

### 10.

Question 10

How does data collected through the monitoring process help the development process of applications?

[ ]The data proves to developers that monitoring needs to be performed regularly to ensure optimal performance of applications and services.

[ ]The data collected during the development process minimizes the time your service is down or running slowly.

[X]Using this data, administrators can identify and solve problems in the development process of applications.

[ ]The data helps decision-makers develop profitable applications and increase the popularity of their apps.

Correct! Due to the complexity of the development process, monitoring tools can provide developers with data about the application.
