Question 1

Your organization has asked you to include two new features in the app you’re developing. The features weren’t initially included in the app’s requirements or design specs. You don’t have time to create the required code from scratch. What can you do to resolve this issue?


[ ]Hire a contractor

[ ]Ask for an extension to the project’s due date

[X]Use dependencies to help add the features

That’s correct! Use dependencies to help add additional functionality without writing code from scratch. Use a package manager to automate the download and installation of dependencies.

[ ]Push the new features to the next major release date

Question 2

Security is often an afterthought during the development of software applications. Correcting insecure code after deployment is very costly. What technique can you implement to avoid concern?


[ ]Implement penetration testing

[ ]Implement a firewall

[X]Implement code practices

That’s correct! Implementing code practices is an integral part of developing secure software and is cost-effective when implemented early in development. Correcting unsecure code later in the software development process is expensive. Implementing code practices helps mitigate vulnerabilities and attacks.

Question 3

Which of the following is a symptom of an insecure development environment?


[X]No protective monitoring, logging, or auditing in place

That’s correct! If the development environment doesn’t have protective monitoring, logging, or auditing in place, then there’s no ability to determine if or when an attack has occurred or if any other vulnerabilities exist. Attackers could infiltrate your organization and remain undetected for months or longer.

[ ]Keeping all software up-to-date

[ ]Using separate machines for coding and business

[ ]Secure build and deployment pipeline

Question 4

Which of the following will help protect a system from malicious scripts?


[X]Output encoding

That’s correct! Output encoding is the translation of input code to safe output code. Implement a policy and practice for each type of outbound encoding used and encode all characters unless any are unsafe for the interpreter. Sanitize all output of untrusted queries such as SQL, XML, and LDAP and sanitize all untrusted data output to local operating system commands.

[ ]Implement a firewall

[ ]Attend training that focuses on secure software development

[ ]Building a reusable object library

Question 5

 Who is responsible for security in application development??


[ ]Security team

[X]Everyone

Feedback: That’s correct! Security is a team effort. Everyone and everything that touches the application, its services, and the platform it runs on is responsible for security from design to deployment to production. DevOps and Security bring a deeper understanding of defensive code development and risks to the systems they’re building on.

[ ]IT Department

[ ]Developer team
