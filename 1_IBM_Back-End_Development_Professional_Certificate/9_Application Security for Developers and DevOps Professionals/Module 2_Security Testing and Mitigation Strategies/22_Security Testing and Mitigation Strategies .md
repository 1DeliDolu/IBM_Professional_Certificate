Question 4

What type of code can you test with static application security testing?


[ ]Web code from the root URL

[ ]Code in production

[ ]Code in dynamic pathways

[X]Source code

Correct

Correct! Static application security testing (or SAST) examines source code to identify security flaws that render your organization's applications vulnerable to attack.

Question 5

Which applications do you evaluate with dynamic analysis?


[X]Fully built applications in production

[ ]Open source libraries

[ ]Applications in all stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)

[ ]Web applications in development

Incorrect

Correct! Dynamic analysis is typically run against fully built applications.

Question 6

What is the purpose of security testing?


[ ]Testing a theory or an idea

[ ]Comparing the states of an application or a system

[ ]Communicating security standards

[X]Providing a secure baseline for development

Correct

Correct! Security testing provides a secure code baseline for development. You should perform security tests on all new code to compare the states of your application.

Question 7

What type of software should you focus on testing with software component analysis (SCA)?


[X]Open source

[ ]Baseline code

[ ]New code in development

[ ]Your team’s repository code

Correct

Correct! SCA is the process of determining which open source components and dependencies are used in your application.
