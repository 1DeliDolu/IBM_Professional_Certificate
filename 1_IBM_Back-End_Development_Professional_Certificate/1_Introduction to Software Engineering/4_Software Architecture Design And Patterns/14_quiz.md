[X] Unified modeling language (UML) diagrams

[ ] A completed software requirements specification (SRS)

[ ] The administrator’s user guide

Correct

Unified modeling language (UML) diagrams are often produced when designing software architecture.

Question 3

You are tasked to analyze the modelling behaviour of the smart thermostat system for its transition between heating, cooling, and idle states. Which of the following best describes a state transition diagram in unified modeling language (UML)?

[ ] A diagram that models the dynamic interaction between the system’s objects

[ ] A diagram that represents step-wise operation systems

[ ] A diagram that shows structural relationships between software modules.

[X] A diagram showing various states in the system and events that cause transitions between those states.

Correct

Behavioral diagram consists of various states and events, demonstrating how the system’s state can change in response to particular events.

Question 4

A developer joins an ongoing software project. They review Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to understand how system components interact. What is the main benefit of using these diagrams?

[X] To quickly understand the system structure and relationships

[ ] To generate JavaScript automatically

[ ] To specify which parameters to use in the code

[ ] To list the required methods for each class

Correct

Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams offer a visual way to explain the software design, which helps bring new team members up to speed quickly on a project.

Question 5

A startup company wants to design an application in which each node captures requests and provides services to the other nodes without a central server. Which of the following architectures is best suited in this scenario?

[ ] Client-server architecture

[X] Peer-to-peer architecture

[ ] Microservices architecture

[ ] Three-tier architecture

Correct

Peer-to-peer architecture allows communication between nodes without a central server.

Question 6

A developer is tasked to create patients in object-oriented analysis and design-based healthcare applications, where the action is to cancel appointments for patients. Which approach does the developer use for representing a patient named Maya in the system?

[ ] By defining Maya as the only class where her properties and actions are hardcoded.

[ ] By creating a general object with no class to handle Maya ’s appointments.

[ ] By coding Maya ’s details inside the system as main data.

[X]

By instantiating the patient class to create an object representing Maya with her specific details and capabilities.

Correct

According to object-oriented analysis and design principles, a specific entity would be modeled as an object instantiated from the patient class, enabling the cancellation of appointments.

Question 7

A developer is designing a desktop application where he wants to add a user interface that directly communicates with the central database server to retrieve data. Which of the following statements describes the correct architecture in this scenario?

[ ] A 2-tier architecture consists of a decentralized network of nodes that are both clients and servers.

[ ] A 2-tier architecture consists of producers and consumers of events.

[X] The interface resides on client machines and requests data or services to a server.

[ ] The two different tiers are the application and data tiers.

Correct

The interface resides on the client machines and requests a server for data or services in a 2-tier architecture.

Question 8

 You are designing a new social media site and want to build it using modular services that interact via APIs. Which architecture pattern is appropriate for this scenario?

[ ] Event-driven architecture

[X] Microservices architecture

[ ] Two-tier architecture

[ ] Peer-to-peer architecture

Correct

Microservices architecture enables applications to break down into modular services that interact with APIs.

Question 9

While launching an application for public users, it is important to secure their information. Which environment should an organization use to launch this application?

[ ] QA teams use a verification system to test application components.

[ ]  The coding team uses the development environment to build software.

[X] The production team deploys a fully operational production system for general users.

[ ] The staging step-up imitates the live environment without public access.

Correct

The production environment is intended for public access, ensuring security, scalability, and reliability.

Question 10

Which component is efficient for diverting heavy website traffic on multiple servers without overloading the main server?

[X] Load balancer

[ ] Firewall

[ ] Proxy server

[ ] Application server

Correct

The load balancers distribute network traffic efficiently amongst multiple servers, preventing overload, and are located between clients and the servers.
