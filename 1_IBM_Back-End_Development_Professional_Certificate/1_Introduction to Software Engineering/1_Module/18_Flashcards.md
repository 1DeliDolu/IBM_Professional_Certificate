Difficulty accommodating changing requirements.



## What is the role of a System Architect in a project?

Designs and communicates project architecture.


## What does design documentation include?

Conceptual and technical design documents.


## What attributes are evaluated in non-functional testing?

Performance, security, scalability, and availability.


## How do goals differ from objectives in requirement gathering?

Goals are broad, long-term outcomes; objectives are specific, actionable, and measurable.


## What is the role of a Site Reliability Engineer?

Ensures software reliability and automates systems.#


## What is the purpose of acceptance testing?

To determine if a system satisfies user needs and requirements.


## What does the System Requirement Specification (SysRS) outline?

System capabilities, interfaces, user characteristics, policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and acceptance criteria.


## What is addressed during the maintenance phase of the SDLC?

Bugs, UI issues, additional requirements.


## What is the main concern of functional testing in software engineering?

Inputs and corresponding outputs of the system.


## What is the purpose of elicitation in requirement gathering?

Gathering requirements through surveys, questionnaires, and interviews.


## What do non-functional requirements specify?

Performance, safety, security, and quality standards.


## What issues defined the software crisis from the mid-1960s to mid-1980s?

Projects over budget, behind schedule, and buggy code.


## What is the vision of a Product Manager?

To create a product that meets client and user needs.


## What is the main focus of the planning phase in the SDLC?

Gathering and analyzing requirements.


## What are the steps involved in the Requirement Gathering Process?

Identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting requirements, documenting, analyzing and confirming, and prioritizing.


## What is the main focus of a software developer?

Building apps and features.


## What does integration testing aim to identify?

Errors in the interaction of combined code modules.


## How does system documentation differ from user documentation?

System documentation is for technical users; user documentation is for non-technical users.


## What is a test case used for in software testing?

To verify the functionality of a software application.


## What is the role of technical documentation?

Includes code comments and working papers to explain code behavior.


## What is the purpose of process documentation?

Describes how to complete a task and provides quality implementation requirements.


## What is the goal of the deployment phase in the SDLC?

Release application to production environment.


## What is the objective of system testing?

To evaluate compliance with specified requirements.



## What is the role of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document?

Guides design and development phases.


## What is the main focus of the Agile Method?

Collaborative process with sprints for quick adaptation.


## Who are considered stakeholders in software development?

Individuals or groups like decision-makers, end-users, system administrators, engineering, marketing, sales, and customer support.


## What are the cons of the Waterfall Method?

Lack of flexibility for changes.


## How does a Technical Writer assist end-users?

Writes documentation for non-technical audiences.


## What are the stages of Software Releases?

Alpha, beta, general availability (GA).


## What is software documentation?

Information about the software describing what the product is and how to use it.
