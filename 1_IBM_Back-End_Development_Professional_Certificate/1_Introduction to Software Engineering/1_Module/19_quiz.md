Question 2: A software development company wants to reduce its development risks and ensure that the project is complete within the timeline with efficiency. Which of the following is best suited in this scenario to achieve the desired goal?

[ ] Assign particular responsibilities to each team member.

[ ] Engage technical writers to develop detailed documentation.

[ ] Allow the team to develop software in an ad-hoc, creative manner.

[X] Use software development lifecycle (SDLC) to provide a structured process.

Correct

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) gives development teams a process to follow to improve efficiency and reduce risks.


Question 3:  After a software system is deployed, ongoing updates and issue resolution are required to ensure smooth operation. Which task is typically performed during the maintenance phase of the SDLC?

[ ] Writing the initial system requirements.

[ ] Performing initial system integration testing.

[ ] Developing core system functionalities.

[X] Resolving minor software bugs and performance issues

Correct

Often, minor issues are found during the maintenance phase, and those issues are then addressed.

Question 4: After a software development, a logistics company is reviewing it. Which key activity should they perform primarily to ensure that the product works as expected?

[ ] Draft user manuals for end users

[ ] Outline the design for the system architecture.

[ ] Release the alpha version for primary testing

[X] Ensuring the software meets requirements.

Correct

Software testing is focused on verifying that software meets the set requirements and is free of errors.

Question 5: You want to incorporate multiple subsystems in your new inventory management platform. The project manager wants a document that contains user and software requirements to focus on the entire scope of the system. Which document should you use in this case?

[ ] Software requirements specification (SRS)

[X] System requirements specifications (SysRS)

[ ] User requirements specification (URS)

[ ] Interface control document (ICD)

Correct

The SysRS combines user and software requirements to define the complete system overview.

Question 6: An organization is planning its software development approach with a strict step-by-step development process in which one phase must be completed before starting a new phase. Which software development lifecycle (SDLC) model does this scenario describe?

[ ] V-shape

[X] Waterfall

[ ] Agile

[ ] Verification

Correct

Waterfall is a sequential method of software development where the output of one phase is the input for the next phase of the cycle.

Question 7: Tara is testing a new software application, ensuring it behaves efficiently according to users’ requirements and is easy to use. Which type of testing should Tara use?

[ ] It tests application attributes like performance and security.

[ ]  It tests application attributes like scalability and availability.

[ ]  It ensures recent changes restrict breaking of the existing functionality.

[X] Its goal is to make sure the application is usable and accessible.

Correct

The goal of functional testing is to make sure the application is usable and accessible.

Question 8: Your team has completed developing and testing a new software. Which process will you use to create a detailed technical document that helps future developers understand the system architecture and operation?

[ ]  Software design

[ ] Software testing

[ ] Code quality

[X]  System documentation

Correct

System documentation explains how to use the software, including README files, inline comments, architecture and design documents, verification information, and maintenance guides.

Question 9:  A tech company is developing a groundbreaking communication platform and needs to determine user interface design responsibilities. Who is primarily responsible for designing the software interface?

[X]  UX designer

[ ] Product Owner

[ ]  Stakeholders
