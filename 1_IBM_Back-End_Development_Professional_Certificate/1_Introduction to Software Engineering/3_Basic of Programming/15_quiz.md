Question 1

Which of the following best describes a program component, such as a stored value, method, interface, or class, by a custom-named label?

[X] Identifier

[ ] Variable

[ ] Container

[ ] Constant

Correct

Identifiers help software developers to reference a program component.

Question 2

A programmer wants to develop a lightweight web-based tool that should run on multiple devices without installation, and the code should be easily updated and executed directly on the user’s device every time they access the tool using an interpreted language. For this scenario, which of the following best describes the interpreted programming language?

[ ] More difficult to write in, but creates faster applications

[ ]

Better for programs installed on the computer or device

[ ]

Available to users who have the same operating system or a device that understands the same language

[X]

A smaller program, normally scripted code, that must be created and repeated every time the code is run

Correct

Programmers generally use interpreted languages for scripts and lightweight programs. This allows small programs, normally scripted code, and allows easy updates with the latest code when users access the tool online.

### 3.

Question 3

A developer is building a high-performance application that needs to run efficiently on the user’s machine. Which type of language would best support this goal?

[ ]

One that generates smaller, script-based programs

[ ]

One that is simpler to learn but needs an interpreter

[ ]

One that is ideal for repeated small tasks in web environments

[X]

One that takes longer to write but results in faster execution

Correct

Writing code in a compiled programming language may take longer, but the code will run faster because it is installed on your computer.

Question 4

An IT analyst is reviewing a project proposal that involves designing a data management system and interacting directly with database systems. He needs to select an appropriate type of programming language or tool for specific tasks related to querying data, manipulating data, or interacting with hardware. Which of the following statements correctly defines the primary purpose of the query language in this scenario?

[ ]

To translate human-readable code directly into machine code instructions

[ ]

To write code that interacts directly with CPU registers and memory using mnemonics

[X]

To request and manipulate data within a database system

[ ]

To create programs using object-oriented principles like classes and objects

Correct

A query language, such as SQL, is primarily used to request data from a database or perform data manipulation operations, such as CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD).

### 5.

Question 5

A student is writing code that needs to evaluate conditions for decision-making. What type of expression evaluates to either “true” or “false” and is commonly used in branching and loop structures?

[ ]

“if-then-else” statement

[ ]

“do-while” loop

[X]

Boolean expression

[ ]

Branching statements

Correct

Boolean logic is a type of programming statement with only two values, “true” or “false,” used in branching and looping programming logic.

Question 6

A team wants to collaborate on a large project that will involve developers from different programming backgrounds. Which method do you use to outline the code logic that is easy to understand, regardless of its preferred language?

[ ]

Write Python code for the project structure

[ ]

Use flowchart symbols and diagrams to display the steps

[X]

Write pseudocode to describe the program steps in simple language, and the steps

[ ]

Start with SQL queries to structure database logic

Correct

Pseudocode provides a language-agnostic method to describe program logic, making it easy for teams to collaborate and understand the flow across the backgrounds.

### 7.

Question 7

In a programming lecture, the instructor mentions “scripting languages” while discussing different types of languages. Which of these programming language types is she most likely referring to?

[ ]

An assembly programming language

[ ]

A query language

[ ]

A compiled programming language

[X]

An interpreted programming language

Correct

Interpreted language is also commonly called scripted or scripting language.

### 8.

Question 8

A programmer must repeat a code block until a certain condition becomes false. Which programming construct should they use?

[ ]

if

[ ]

switch

[X]

while

[ ]

GoTo

Correct

while is a looping programming logic.

Question 9

Tanya is building a program where she needs to store items that will automatically grow or shrink as users add or remove entries. Which type of container should she use?

[X]

Vector

[ ]

Constant

[ ]

Variable

[ ]

Array

Correct

The Vector container allows resizing of items, making it fit for use when the number of elements is not fixed.

### 10.

Question 10

Amira is learning a programming methodology where real-world objects like cars or customers are modeled in code. What type of methodology is she learning?

[ ]

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

[ ]

Modular programming

[ ]

Extreme programming

[X]

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Correct

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) models real-world entities like customers or vehicles as objects in code, making it ideal for scenarios that reflect real-world structures.
